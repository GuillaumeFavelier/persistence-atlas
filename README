INSTRUCTIONS
===
The following instructions are for Unix environments (MacOS, Linux, etc.). For
Windows users, please follow the usual procedure to import a CMake project into
VisualStudio (please be careful though, important directory paths may need to
be changed for the program to run properly).


1) Software requirements:
==
This code requires the VTK development libraries to be installed on the system
(version 6.1 or higher). Please see http://www.vtk.org/ for installation
instructions.

A recent version of ParaView (http://www.paraview.org) should be installed (tested
with version 5.4.1).

A recent version of CMake (http://www.cmake.org) should be installed (tested
with version 2.8).

A recent version of Boost (http://www.boost.org/) should be installed (tested
with version 1.49.0).

A recent version of Python (http://www.python.org/) should be installed (tested
with version 3.6.3).

A recent version of SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/) should be installed (tested
with version 0.18.1).

A recent version of Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) should be installed (tested
with version 1.12.1).

A recent version of Scikit-learn (http://www.scikit-learn.org/) should be
installed (tested with version 0.19.0).

Assuming that a Ubuntu 18.04 system is used, enter the following commands to
install the required dependencies:

$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install g++ cmake libboost-dev libvtk6-dev python3-dev \
  python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-sklearn paraview


2) Compiling the code:
==
Enter the 'persistence-atlas' directory and type the following command (omit the "$" character):

$ mkdir build install
$ cd build

From there, enter the following commands:

$ cmake ../ttk -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install

Depending on your system, you may need to tell cmake where to find
the numpy include directory by adding:
-DPYTHON_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIR=<numpy-location>

For Ubuntu distribution such directory may be:
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy/core/include

For Arch Linux distribution, we may need to add the following:
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags python3`

If you have built your own version of VTK, you can tell cmake where
to find it by adding:
-DVTK_DIR=<vtk-location>/build

Next, enter the following command to build and install:

$ make install


3) Reproducing the results from the paper:
==
Download the ZIP archive from the following website (please use a web browser):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PffcEKpy7YQKF0mLtube-mh-vxPeiw3-/view?usp=sharing

And extract the ZIP archive in the 'persistance-atlas' directory with:

$ unzip data.zip

Then from the directory 'persistence-atlas', enter the following command:

$ scripts/runtime.sh

The above script will compute all the outputs presented in the paper and will provide
the total time for each use-case (see the lines starting by 'real').

If you want to start only a specific use-case, do it with the following command:

for Vortex street:
$ scripts/vortexStreet.sh

for Isabella:
$ scripts/isabella.sh

for Starting vortex:
$ scripts/startingVortex.sh

for Sea Surface Height:
$ scripts/seaSurfaceHeight.sh

for Gaussians;
$ scripts/gaussians.sh

These commands will generate several VTK files that ParaView can load
and the results can be seen as scalar fields on these data sets:

The file pmb.* contains the persistence map of each ensemble member.
The file ldm.vtu corresponds to the distance matrix between the persistence maps.
The file sfp.vtp is the planar view of the ensemble.
The file(s) mcp_{min,max}.* represent(s) the mandatory critical points of each cluster.

For reference, log files for each of these scripts are available in 'persistence-atlas/log'.

These plugins use VTK Unstructured Grid (vtu) or VTK Image Data (vti) files.
In the case of an image data, an implicit triangulation is built.

The scalar fields must be associated to the points.
